\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}
There is a growing number of applications in our lives that rely on robots, which leads to cheaper, smarter, more reliable robotic systems. However, there are still numerous applications where humans cannot be utilized; either because the environment is too hostile or humans are not quick, precise, or reliable enough to make them economically viable agents. Some examples of applications with hostile environments include mine sweeping, sweeping ocean floor for debris, search and rescue in the wilderness, natural disaster rescue efforts, and nuclear meltdown containment efforts. Here, the situation is too risky to let humans operate in those conditions. Some examples of applications with tight economic are factory paint finish, industrial floor sweeping, CNC drilling, and crop monitoring among others. And here, the speed and precision of humans is often not good enough to create the end product in a quick enough effort to meet the cost requirement.

These examples motivate the use of robots to achieve the end goal with required performance specifications. Moreover, with the proliferation of robotics, robotic systems in general are becoming more affordable. For some applications, it's becoming economically feasible to use teams of robots to achieve a common goal. There is one problem that is common to all of the listed applications. That is the problem of the coverage path planning. That are various version of this problem with a lot of work in the literature. A solution to the problem of coverage path planning is a path for some robot that results in all point of the environment being under the robots footprint at some point along the path. This problem is known to be NP-complete and therefore, no optimal solution is known. In fact, many works in the literature propose approximate solutions that theoretically achieve the complete coverage but in practice, produce unfeasible paths.

In this work, we develop a solution to the problem of coverage path planning, which produce resultant paths that are dynamically feasible. We aim to compute paths that consists of as many straight line segments as possible. This is motivated by the fact that straight line segments are one of the easiest paths to traverse of many robotic systems. 

In our algorithm, we utilize special types of paths called Boustrophedon paths. These types of path are simple and facilitate theoretical analysis. We introduce a metric, which aids in the optimal orientation of Boustrophedon paths. We design a greedy algorithm that partitions a polygon with the objective of minimizing the overall altitude of a polygon. We also provide proofs of correctness and computational complexity analysis. These results are supported by simulations. 

Finally, we extend these results to the multi-agent coverage. In the multi-agent coverage path planning problem, a team of robots with their own respective dynamics are tasked to achieve complete coverage of a polygon. We develop a partitioning scheme that divide up the workspace into regions and assign regions to each robot based on its abilities. This is to ensure that all robot perform comparable amount of work.
