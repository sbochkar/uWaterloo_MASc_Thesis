\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chapter:literature_review}

The problem of coverage path planning sees many applications across numerous fields. The list includes applications like material polishing~\cite{rososhansky2010coverage}, autonomous farming~\cite{ollis1997vision}, demining~\cite{acar2003path}, floor cleaning~\cite{yasutomi1988cleaning}, and many others. The roots of this problem could be traced to CNC trajectory planning where operators rely on their experience and intuition to plan an optimal trajectory for a tool to cut out different shapes out of a slab of metal. Perhaps one of the earliest works in literature is the work by Cao~\cite{cao1988region} where the authors outline the requirements for a coverage path. These conditions state that all points in the workspace must be covered, there should be no footprint overlap, all obstacles are to be avoided, and optimality is desired. These conditions are strict in that it is not always possible to fully satisfy them. However, this work has set the stage for the future research.

One of the key contributions to the field of coverage is the work by Arkin~\cite{arkin2000approximation}. The authors have studied two variations of the coverage problem: lawn mowing and milling. The difference is that milling problem does not allow the robot to cross the boundary of its workspace. The authors were able to show that these problems are in fact NP-hard, which means the computational time to solve it increases dramatically with the size of the input. Some of the other problems related to coverage are the Travelling Salesman Problem, art gallery problem, and a watchman route problem.

There are various classifications used when talking about coverage problems. Choset~\cite{choset2000coverage} have classified majority of the approaches by the methods used to discretized the environment. He summarized these to be either exact or approximate. However, since his survey, numerous new works have been published that do not strictly fall into these two categories. The new categories would include random and pseudo-random approaches, 3D coverage, coverage under uncertainty, persistent coverage, cooperative coverage, and others. In this section, we aim to review some of the important works involving exact and approximate decompositions as well as works that deal with the cooperative coverage.

\section{Exact Cellular Decomposition}
\label{section:exact_cellular_decomposition}

Typically, approaches that rely on exact cellular decomposition compute a solution in two steps. The first step involves performing some sort of decomposition on the workspace resulting in a set of cells that together make up the original workspace. The second step involves computing a path for each region separately. One of the classic examples of this is in the work by Latombe~\cite{latombe1991exact} where a trapezoidal decomposition is performed on a polygonal planar workspace. The resulting decomposition consists of trapezoidal cells. An adjacency graph can be computed for these cells where an edge between two vertices exists if two cells are adjacent. A tour of this graph is computed where each cell is visited once. The coverage of each cell is by a \emph{zig-zag} like path.  In practice, this method was used on an agricultural field by Oksanen~\cite{Oksanen2009coverage}. Despite the simplicity of its computation, there are numerous drawbacks to this method. One of them is the excess of cells generated, which leads to a significant overhead associated with transitioning between cells. Another problem is the direction of these zig-zag paths. This direction is determined by the decomposition. However, this direction could lead to a non optimal result. Another problem is the generality of this method with respect to the shape of the footprint. For example, a circular footprint would not be able to cover areas near the corners. As such, the path generated by this method would not be able to achieve complete coverage.

To mitigate the problem of excessive number of cells, Choset~\cite{choset2000coverage} proposed a new decomposition technique called the Boustrophedon decomposition. The Boustrophedon decomposition is very similar to the trapezoidal decomposition with the exception that some cells in the decomposition may be non-convex and the overall number of cells in the decomposition is reduced. The path planning components is identical to Latombe's approach and therefore, suffers from similar drawbacks.

Wong~\cite{wong2004complete}'s landmark based decomposition is similar to the Boustrophedon but works for general workspace. His approach is also suitable for on-line sensor based coverage. However, the individual cells are covered via the same zig-zag type paths.

Acar~\cite{Acar2002morse} proposed a more general decomposition technique that works on non-polygonal workspaces and could generate cells of various shapes to accommodate any coverage requirements. This decomposition is based on finding critical points of a Morse function. Boustrophedon decomposition is a specific case of a Morse decomposition where the Morse function is a straight line. Moreover, the search for these critical points can be performed on-line leading to a number of on-line coverage algorithms~\cite{acar2002sensor}. The main drawback of this approach is that rectilinear workspace cannot be used. 

Huang~\cite{Huang2001optimal} studied an approach to decomposition that minimizes the zig-zag paths within each cell. In his work, he proposed a dynamic programming approach to shaping the cells of the decomposition in a way that minimizes the number of parallel segments of a zig-zag path within each cell. However, the transitions costs between cells are completely ignored.

Recently, in the work by Das at el.~\cite{das2014mapping}, a greedy decomposition of a polygonal environment was proposed that seems to result in fewer convex cells for typical workspace polygons. As with other approaches, a tour of the graph is computed. However, the inter-coverage of each individual cell is computed based on the graph tour. Specifcally, the entry and exit points are picked in a way that minimizes the transition costs between segments. However, the downside is that this methods leads to non-optimal coverage within the cells.

There is a common underlying problem with exact decomposition methods. The problem of convex decomposition is known to be NP-hard for general polygons as outlined in the survey by Keil~\cite{keil2000polygon}. As such, most of the exact decompositions algorithms utilize heuristics. Moreover, there is a inter-dependency between inter-cell and intra-cell coverage. In other words, a good solution cannot focus on optimal inter-cell coverage but ignore the intra-cell transitions or vice versa.

\section{Grid Based Approaches}
\label{section:grid_based_approaches}

Exact cellular decompositions is not the only available class of solutions. Another class includes grid-based methods, sometimes referred to as approximate decomposition methods. Typically, the workspace is represented as a grid of uniform cells. Such representation is easy to compute but the memory requirement scales exponentially with the size of the workspace.

Zelinsky~\cite{Zelinsky1993planning} proposed a grid based coverage solution based on a wave propagation algorithm. With this method, a start and a goal cells are given. A front is created by computing the distance from the goal to the cell. Coverage is ensured by traversing the wave front, a set of cells where the values are equal. On-line generalization is available by Shrivashakar et al.~\cite{shivashankar2011real}. The work by by Gabriely and Rimon~\cite{Gabriely2001spanning} is based on a spanning tree generation. The grid acts as a graph were every cell is a node. A minimum spanning tree can be computed for slightly modified version of this graph. A path is generated by tracing the edges of the tree, which ensures all cells are covered at least once. Arkin~\cite{arkin2000approximation} also proposed some approximate solutions based on a grid decomposition of the workspace. The workspace is represented in the form of a grid where the center point is a node in a graph. Such graph is fed into a Travelling Salesman Problem solver and the shortest tour is compute.

All of the mentioned approaches share similar downsides. The representation of the workspace by a grid is approximate. Hence, it is expected to see some points near corners or the boundary not being covered. Furthermore, computational load for large environment makes these methods intractable. Furthermore, these methods do not translate to optimal path in real life even if a shortest tour of a grid is found. This is evident when one looks at the grid shape and the coverage footprint shape. For instance, if a coverage footprint is a shape of a circle then one should expect overlap between two adjacent cells. This leads to lose of efficiency of the coverage path and results in longer paths.


\section{Minimizing Turns in Coverage Paths}
\label{section:minimizing_turns_in_coverage_paths}

So far all the works listed here did not consider any dynamics of the robot in its path planning procedure. However, it is an important aspect for a good solution. Many of the proposed solutions in literature produce paths that may not be feasible for the type of robots that perform coverage. As outlined before, applications determine the exact quality that are desirable from the coverage path. However, at is core, a coverage path should take dynamics of the robot into account. One way to do is by recongnizing that turns play an important part in the cost of a path. There are some works that tried to tackle this issue.

The work by Huang~\cite{Huang2001optimal} attempted to solve this by proposing a decomposition scheme via dynamics programming. Arkin~\cite{arkin2005optimal} have studied a TSP like solution with turning cost embedded into the cost and proposing an appeoximation algorithm along with Wagner~\cite{wagner2001approximation}. However, these two present solutions where the paths can take only rectillinear orientation, which is restrictive in the real world environment.


\section{Multi-agent Coverage}
\label{section:multi_agent_coverage_lit_review}

With proliferation of robotics, the cost of robots has gone down to the point where it makes sense to usem ulitple robots to achieve the goal faster. A lot of works in literature, extend the single agent coverage results by performing what's called as the work division whereby after each robot has its own area ssigned to it.

The work by Durham~\cite{durham2012discrete} outlines a solution to the  multi-agent coverage under unreliable communication network. The environment is modeled as a grid with obstacles where the robots can move from one cell to another in the grid. The objective is to compute a partition that minimizes the coverage cost function. The computation of this function shares some similarities to Voronoi partitioning. The partitioning algorithm relies in pair-wise partitioning and reaches pair-wise optimality. The problem with this approach is that the environment as modeled as an occupancy grid. Also, this approach differs from ours as the robots is not requires to visit all cells; therfore, the cost function used in the optimization of the partition reflects that.

The work by Maza~\cite{maza2007multiple} proposed a solution to multi-agent coverage. Given $n$ robots, they partition the polygonal environment into $n$ regions. The partition is performed by anchored area partitioning algorithm. The area amount is reflective of the abilities of the robot. Once, the partition is formed, each robot cover their regions in an optimal sweeping fashion. The problems with the proposed approach is that the work only considered convex polygons. Furthermore, the assumption that the area alone reflects the abilities of the robot is too restrictive.

The work in \cite{barrientos2011aerial} have considered a similar problem with aerial drones. The divide the problem into three sections. First is the task allocation and the second is the path planning for each individual drone. The subregions are represented as a grid. This work shares a lot of similarities to the previous author but with extensive test trials.

Hokeyam~\cite{hokayem2007dynamic} worked on an algorithmic approach to coverage by robots following inner level sets of the polygonal workspace. Any collisions between robots are resolved by sporadic communications. The problem with using inner level sets of a polygon is that they make sense for convex polygons. However, for nonconvex polygons, some of these level sets become complicated. 

In another work~\cite{atincc2013supervised}, a control law for sensor coverage is developed for a team of robots that is based on gradient representation of coverage with the addition of the transition control law that helps the robots avoid local minima of gradients.

Another multi-robot visual coverage method developed by Valente~\cite{valente2011multi} where the approach is similar to our and that of Barrientos~\cite{barrientos2011aerial} where the robot divide the area via communications and plan the path accordingly. The assumption made here is that of convex polygon. One of the metric is the number of turns.

There are a number of works that study the coverage in a sense of sensor coverage. That is the problem becomes that of designing a control law that guides the robot to a location in the environment that maximizes some utility function


%The generation of an optimal coverage path for convex work spaces is tractable and can be solved efficiently using sweeping or spiralling motions. Minimum turn coverage for convex polygons has been considered in~\cite{maza2007multiple}. For general workspaces, the coverage problem is NP-hard~\cite{arkin2000approximation}. However, there are many approximate and heuristic approaches to coverage. One class of approaches is an \emph{exact} convex decomposition on the workspace in which the workspace is partitioned into convex regions. A coverage path consists of a tour of each region, with local coverage of a convex region performed with either sweeping or spiralling motion. Commonly-used methods for decomposition include Boustrophedon decomposition~\cite{Choset1998coverage}, its more general form, Morse-based decomposition~\cite{Acar2002morse}, and trapezoidal decomposition~\cite{Oksanen2009coverage}. Huang~\cite{Huang2001optimal} proposed a dynamic programming approach for generating a set of regions that minimize the number of turns in the overall coverage path. However, the runtime is exponential, and the cost associated with transitions between these regions is assumed to be negligible. Das~\cite{das2014mapping} used a greedy cut method for convex decomposition and computed a tour of the regions using a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver.

%With exact decomposition, the quality of the coverage path is highly-dependent on the convex decomposition. For polygons without holes (obstacles), there are several suboptimal and optimal decomposition algorithms available~\cite{keil2000polygon}. Convex decomposition for polygons with holes is NP-hard~\cite{lingas1982power}. A drawback of exact decomposition is that for complex workspaces, the decomposition may contain many regions, resulting in large total transition costs between regions.



%Another class of approaches is \emph{approximate} convex decomposition~\cite{Galceran2013surveycpp}, in which convex regions may overlap, and the union of regions approximates the workspace (points left uncovered are typically handled in a second pass). In the most common approach, each of the overlapping region is a coverage footprint, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:footprints}(a). Local coverage of each region is ensured by visiting the region's center. Complete coverage becomes the problem of planning a tour that visits each center with minimum cost~\cite{arkin2000approximation}. A drawback of this method is that the overlap between regions reduces the efficiency of the overall coverage path. Also, the number of regions grows with the area of the workspace, making the problem of computing tours of the centers intractable for large spaces.

%There are many works that deal with multi-agent coverage. The concept of area coverage could be divided into classes. One has to be careful navigating the literature to pick the right class of coverage.
